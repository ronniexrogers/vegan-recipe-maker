# vegan-recipe-maker

<img src="/initial-framework.jpg" />

My idea is to create a functioning web application that will fetch data from a food API, filter through that information to only show foods that are vegan friendly, then allow the user to see results based on criteria that they provided.  

I will code this using JS, HTML, React, and possibly ReactStrap if time permits.
