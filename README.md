# vegan-recipe-maker

My idea is to create a functioning web application that will fetch data from a food API, filter through that information to only show foods that are vegan friendly.

-Users will be able to search for foods based on specific criteria such as ingredients and style of cuisine.
-Users will be able to view a list of recipes that match their search criteria.
-Users will be able to select a recipe from the list and view how to cook it.

I will code this using JS, HTML, React, and possibly ReactStrap if time permits. 

The API I will be using is https://spoonacular.com/food-api/ . I expect to receive a collection of recipes which I will filter through based on if it is vegan and also user criteria.
