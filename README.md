# vegan-recipe-maker

My idea is to create a functioning web application that will fetch data from a food API, filter through that information to only show food recipes that are vegan friendly.

- As a user, I will be greeted at the home screen by a search bar as well as a description of the application that shows what it is and how it works. I will be able to search for vegan friendly recipes based on criteria I provide.  Once I submit my ingredients, I will be taken to a page of results showing recipes I can make with the ingredients I specified.  Once, I find the recipe I want, I can click on it to view a full detailed recipe.

I will code this using JS, HTML, React, and possibly ReactStrap if time permits. 

The API I will be using is https://spoonacular.com/food-api/ . I expect to receive a collection of recipes which I will filter through based on if it is vegan and also user criteria.

A stretch goal will be to incorporate an additional filter that allows you to sort by cuisine type.
