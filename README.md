<b>What is it?</b>
<br>
Vegan Recipe Finder is a useful tool I developed to help myself stop wasting groceries.  I can't tell you how many times I've boughten groceries only for them to rot in the refrigerator due to me not knowing what to do with them.  That is where Vegan Recipe Finder comes into play!  Simply type in the ingredients you want to see recipes for.  Then, the application will take your keywords and dig through a database of 1,000s of recipes that match your criteria.  It really is that simple!
<br><br>
<b>What technologies did I use to develop this app?</b>
<br>
For this application, I started out by coding the entire thing in Javascript, React, and HTML with very minimal CSS styling.  Then I implemented styling using Reactstrap.
